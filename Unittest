When comparing unittest vs pytest,that recommends pytest for most people.
In the question“What are the best Python unit testing frameworks?” 
pytest is ranked 1st while unittest is ranked 3rd. The most important reason people chose pytest is:

The idioms that pytest first introduced brought a change in the Python community 
because they made it possible for test suites to be written in a very compact style, 
or at least far more compact than was ever possible before.
Pytest basically introduced the concept that Python tests should be plain Python functions instead of forcing
developers to include their tests inside large test classes.
